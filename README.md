# My-Portfolio
Creating my very own portfolio

## Description
Hey all, My name is Eric Reyes and I am currently learning the basics of how to code! I am hoping to create much more on here as I learn and progress through the course.

## Usage
Towards the end of my bootcamp, I am hoping to have this portfolio much more updated with what I will learn through the course, and have it look like an actual developer's portfolio!

## License
Please refer to the repo for the license.

## Features
So far none, but I am hoping to add many features throughout the months!

## How to Contribute
I would love constructive criticism on my portfolio! It is nowhere near where I would want it, and would love to hear any reccomendations on how to improve.
